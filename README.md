# material-brackets
A Brackets port of Mattia Astorino's Material theme for Sublime Text.

# Dependencies

As Brackets doesn't allow UI theming by default, I have used Ryan McKay's brackets-uitheming extension. Download it from the Brackets Extension Manager. Otherwise you get the default UI colors.
